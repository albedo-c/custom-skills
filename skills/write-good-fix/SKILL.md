## What I do

- Run `write-good` against all documentation and source files containing English prose
- Interpret every suggestion (passive voice, weasel words, adverbs, etc.) in context
- Edit files directly using file editing tools to improve clarity and directness
- Only touch human-readable prose — never alter code logic, APIs, or variable names

## When to use me

Use this skill when you want to improve the quality of written English in:

- Markdown and RST documentation (`.md`, `.mdx`, `.rst`, `.txt`)
- Python docstrings and `#` comments
- JavaScript/TypeScript JSDoc comments and `//` or `/* */` comments
- YAML/TOML configuration file comments
- README files, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING guides
- Error messages and user-facing strings

**Do NOT use for:** autogenerated files, vendored code, or any file not authored by the project team.

## Step-by-step workflow

### 1. Verify write-good is available

```bash
write-good --version
# or if installed to ~/.local/bin:
~/.local/bin/write-good --version
```

If not installed:

```bash
npm install -g write-good
# or to user prefix (no sudo):
npm install -g write-good --prefix ~/.local
```

### 2. Discover all prose-heavy files

```bash
# Documentation files
find . -type f \( -name "*.md" -o -name "*.rst" -o -name "*.txt" \) \
  -not -path "./.git/*" \
  -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
  -not -path "*/.venv/*" \
  -not -path "*/dist/*"

# Source files (check comments and docstrings)
find . -type f \( -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.tsx" \) \
  -not -path "./.git/*" \
  -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
  -not -path "*/.venv/*"
```

### 3. Run write-good on documentation files

```bash
~/.local/bin/write-good --parse *.md docs/**/*.md README.md CONTRIBUTING.md 2>/dev/null
```

Or process files one at a time for focused output:

```bash
~/.local/bin/write-good --parse README.md
```

The output format is:

```
"<offending phrase>" on line X at column Y
-------------
<reason>
```

### 4. Understand what write-good checks

| Check                 | What it flags                       | Example fix                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Passive voice**     | "was stolen", "is being used"       | "stole", "uses"                   |
| **Weasel words**      | "very", "quite", "rather", "mostly" | Remove or be specific             |
| **Adverbs**           | "-ly" words that weaken verbs       | Remove or use stronger verb       |
| **"So" at start**     | Sentences beginning with "So"       | Rephrase or remove "So"           |
| **There is/are**      | "There is a problem"                | "A problem exists" or restructure |
| **Lexical illusions** | Repeated words "the the"            | Remove duplicate                  |
| **Clichés**           | "at the end of the day"             | Rephrase directly                 |

### 5. Apply fixes — rules for editing

When fixing prose, follow these principles:

**For passive voice:**

- Change `"The file is read by the parser"` → `"The parser reads the file"`
- Only fix when the active subject is clear and makes the sentence cleaner

**For weasel words:**

- Remove vague qualifiers: `"This is very important"` → `"This is important"` or be specific: `"This prevents data corruption"`
- Replace `"basically"`, `"essentially"`, `"generally"` with precise language

**For adverbs:**

- `"This function quickly processes"` → `"This function processes"` or use a stronger verb: `"This function streams"`

**For documentation specifically:**

- Keep technical accuracy — do not change what a sentence means
- Preserve code spans, links, and formatting exactly
- Do not alter version numbers, command examples, or file paths within prose

**For source code comments:**

- Fix the text inside `#`, `//`, `/* */`, `"""`, `'''` blocks
- Do not touch code on the same line as a trailing comment if the code would be affected
- For multiline docstrings: fix the English but preserve all parameter names, types, and return descriptions exactly

### 6. Process files systematically

For each file with suggestions:

1. Read the full file content first
2. Identify each flagged passage in context
3. Decide: is the suggestion valid? Some flags (especially passive voice in technical docs) are intentionally passive and should be kept
4. Apply the edit using the file editing tool
5. Re-run write-good on the file to confirm the suggestion is resolved

### 7. Review the diff

Before committing, always review all changes:

```bash
git diff
```

For each changed file, verify:

- The fix improves clarity without changing the meaning
- Technical terms, API names, version numbers are preserved
- Links and code examples are intact
- The change is not overly aggressive (e.g., don't change every passive voice if it makes sentences harder to understand)

If any change looks wrong:
- Revert that specific file: `git checkout -- path/to/file`
- Re-evaluate whether the fix should be applied

### 8. Commit the changes

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: improve prose clarity based on write-good suggestions

Reviewed each suggestion and applied fixes manually.
Addressed passive voice, weasel words, and weak phrasing in comments
and documentation. No functional changes to code logic."```

## Rules and guardrails

- **Never** change code — only prose within strings, comments, docstrings, and documentation
- If a passive construction is a deliberate style choice (e.g. API docs that say "The token is returned"), and changing it makes the sentence less clear, keep it as-is
- Prioritize documentation files first, then source code comments
- Do not apply every single suggestion blindly — use judgment; technical writing sometimes requires constructions write-good flags
- Never rewrite sentences so substantially that the meaning changes
- If you are unsure about a fix, leave the original and add a `<!-- TODO: write-good: ... -->` comment in docs, or `# TODO: write-good: ...` in source
